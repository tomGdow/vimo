    NAME

       vimo

       This bash script opens a file in vim from anywhere within an application
       framework.  

    SYNOPSIS

        vimo [-c] [-d] [-f] [-h] [-i] [-l] [-v]  <search term>

    DESCRIPTION

       vimo may be used to open any file from within an application 
       root directory without the need to change directory or specify 
       file paths. For example, 'vimo routes.rb' opens the 'routes.rb' 
       file from any directory within a Ruby-on-Rails application.  

       The script is written with Ruby-on-Rails and Middleman in mind. 
       It works best from within applications generated by these frameworks,
       but it may be used anywhere (albeit with restricted functionality).

       It is also not restricted to vim, but will open files in any editor
       specified by the EDITOR ENV variable

       Directories may be searched for, but not opened in ${EDITOR}, 
       using the '-d' option.

       Outside the root directory, the file path may have to be specified.

       If more than one file or directory is found, the output is a 
       numbered list, from which a file (but not a directory) may be 
       selected and opened in ${EDITOR}. 

       If only a single file is found, it is by default opened 
       automatically in ${EDITOR}.

       The basic search command is of the following form, 
       where VIMODIR strives to be the application root directory.

		      find VIMODIR -type f -name <search-term> 

    OPTIONS 

      -c: use current directory. When this option is used, the basic 
          search command is of the type:
         
          find . -type f -name <search-term>
       
      -f: give the full directory path
      -d: search for directories only
      -h: get help
      -i: case-insensitive search
      -l: give a list of file locations only (open in text editor 
          functionality disabled) 
      -v: verbose mode. Gives, among other things, a list of functions
          called. 

    REQUIREMENTS
      
      (1)  The EDITOR ENV variable need not be set, but may be set to an
           editor of choice. The default value is vim.
           You may wish to execute the following prior to running the
           script. 
           EDITOR='vim'
           export EDITOR
           Or, include the following line in your .bashrc file
           export EDITOR='vim'

      (2)  The VIMODIR ENV variable controls working directory and
           strives to be the application root directory.
           It may be changed to the current working directory as follows:
           VIMODIR=\$(pwd) 
           export VIMODIR
           Alternatively,
           VIMODIR='/full/path/to/working/directory' 
           export VIMODIR
           Or, include the following line in your .bashrc file
           export VIMODIR='/full/path/to/working/directory'
     
      (3)  The VIMOMAX ENV variable controls the maximum number of 
           search results shown. If the number exceeds VIMOMAX, the user
           is given the choice whether to continue or abort.
           This ENV variable need not be set, and defaults to the value
           of 30. It may be changed as follows:
           VIMOMAX=50
           export VIMOMAX
           Or, include the following line in your .bashrc file
           export VIMOMAX=50

    NOTES
      (1)  Tested with Rails 4 and Rails 5, and Middleman 
      (2)  It is best to double-quote search terms, especially if 
           wildcards are included 
      (3)  vimo may be used to search for either files or 
           directories, but not both.  The default behaviour is to 
           find files only.

    EXAMPLE USAGE
      (1)  vimo "routes.rb"  
      (2)  vimo -l "index*"   
      (3)  vimo -cl "index.html.erb" 
      (4)  vimo -clf "index.html*" 
      (5)  vimo -i "gemfile" 
      (6)  vimo -vil "gemfile" 
      (7)  vimo -d  "stylesheet*"
